## Collection of labs completed in IS160, AI in Business course. 

## LAB 1: Manual Calculation of DL

Lab 1 was on manually calculating Deep Learning with our partners. The DL calculation example in the Michael Tayler book was used. We put down weight and bias weight calculations, summations, the activation function, total error, and gradients. Below are images of our written work on the calculation.

## LAB 2: Deep Learning CNN with Dot Product

Lab 2 focused on viewing the notebook given to us and then changing parts to get our desired outcome. We then had to create a Dot Product with our values to check we did them correctly.

## Lab 3: MNIST Data

In Lab 3 we had to create two models, the MNIST model from the Chollet book, and an MNIST model from ChatGPT. This was to practice our ability to use GPT to our advantage. 

## Lab 4: DL Exploration

For Lab 4, as a pair, we created two models. The first is the IMDB data DL model from the Chollet book and then we collected three datasets of our choice from Kaggle or any sources we like for the second model. We tried different loss functions and optimizers for comparison and added comments within our codes.

## Lab 5: Big City Taxi Fare DL Model

In Lab 5, we were displayed some formulas and data on the whiteboard. We had to pretend to write down how we would code on paper. We had to use three different dates and times as well.

## Lab 6: Big City Taxi Fare DL Model

For Lab 6, we had to actually put in our written code from Lab 5 into our computers. We used the same formulas and data provided to us.

## Lab 7: Prompt Eng. - Stable Diffusion

In Lab 7, we used Paperspace to start a notebook and upload a provided kernel for stable diffusion. We ran all cells in order to get the link we needed to access it. As a pair, we decided on images we wanted to create using AI and gave descriptive prompts to get our desired results. 

## Lab 8: Image to Image - Stable Diffusion

Similar to the previous lab, Lab 8 focused on editing images we already had and inputting them to create more customized images we wanted. We used and edited four different images and compared them to each of their pairs. We used features such as inpaint, denoiser function, and masking. 

## Summary

Throughout these labs, I have gained experience with AI and insight into how of many of these processes work and what they mean. It can be of benefit when needing to work with something involving AI because I have gotten a base on the concept and functionality.
